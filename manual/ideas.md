# Neat ideas for the future

  * A manual :)
  * A building system for the Rewtro console (minify, static PWA etc.)
  * Implement multiple papercraft templates. Solid models are probably more fragile than flat models but are undoubtly _cooler_ an may offer more storage. An alternative model has been suggested.
    * _tyingq from Hacker News_: I'd switch to this pattern to make the cube: http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/origam16.gif Sturdier, less cutting, and would be more "true oragami". Though maybe the folds would make it harder to scan along the face edges.
  * Use alternative _barcodes_ to encode games, like [HCCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Capacity_Color_Barcode). It can help making better games in the same amount of paper space. Need a JavaScript encoder/decoder to give it a shot.
    * _PostOnce  from Hacker News_: If you ever do a successor format, color triangle barcodes can store 3x as much information per square inch -- so you could either have just one scannable code on the back of the cart, or have 3x as much game with the current method.
