# Neat ideas for the future

  * A build system for the Rewtro console (minify, static PWA etc.)
  * Implement multiple papercraft templates. Solid models are probably more fragile than flat models but are undoubtly _cooler_ an may offer more storage. An alternative model has been suggested.
    * _tyingq from Hacker News_: I'd switch to this pattern to make the cube: http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/origam16.gif Sturdier, less cutting, and would be more "true oragami". Though maybe the folds would make it harder to scan along the face edges.
  * Use alternative _barcodes_ to encode games, like [HCCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Capacity_Color_Barcode). It can help making better games in the same amount of paper space. Need a JavaScript encoder/decoder to give it a shot.
    * _PostOnce  from Hacker News_: If you ever do a successor format, color triangle barcodes can store 3x as much information per square inch -- so you could either have just one scannable code on the back of the cart, or have 3x as much game with the current method.
  * Encode a game in noises/soundtrack. Look for unused sequences/hidden tracks etc. Playback of encoded audio from the datasette. Tested some modem examples but looks like that a cable is needed for faster and reliable data transfer.
    * _emanueldo on GameLoop.it Discord_: Sarebbe bello nascondere il codice di un gioco in una banda di frequenze inutilizzata e magari nella soundtrack del gioco stesso XD
  * Move these notes on GitHub one day.
    * _encelo on GameLoop.it Discord_: perche' non usi un issue di GitHub per le idee/note?
